# Drop_Lev

Welcome to the DropLev project. In this depository you can find the data presented in the publication ''.....'' and the machine learning algorithm that was develeoped for the prediction of surface tension of acoustically leitated droplets. 

The in-silico data were generated from the theory developed by Marston et al. 

In the folder ''Data'' you can download the zip folders containing the data used for the training and testing of the neural network. 



In the folder ''Machine learning'' you can find the machine learning algorithms applied on in-silico data and experimental data.
