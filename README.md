# Drop_Lev

Welcome to the DropLev project. In this depository you can find the data and machine learning algorithm that was develeoped for the prediction of surface tension of acoustically leitated droplets in the article: DOI...

The in-silico data were generated from the theory developed by Marston et al. [1-3]. The equation used for the generation of the theoretical contours can be found in reference 3.

In the folder ''Data'' you can download the zip folders containing the data used for the training and testing of the neural network. 


In the folder ''Machine learning'' you can find the machine learning algorithms applied on in-silico data and experimental data.
